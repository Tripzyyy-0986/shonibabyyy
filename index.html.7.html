      Happy New Year, my Shoniii baby :) 🤍✨ As this new year begins, I just want to tell you how deeply you mean to me and how much I truly love you. You are not just my girlfriend, you are my heart, my comfort, and the most important person in my life. I miss you more than I can ever put into words, and not a single day goes by where ur not on my mind. Every thought of you brings warmth to my heart, and every memory of us reminds me how lucky I am to have you. Even when we’re apart, ur always w me in my thoughts, in my heart, and in everything I do. We’ve been through so much together, so many struggles, misunderstandings, and moments that tested us, but what makes us special is that we never gave up on each other. We chose to talk, to understand, and to solve everything together, and that is something I will always be proud of. Those hard moments didn’t break us, they only made our bond stronger and our love deeper. You stood by me when things weren’t easy, and your support and patience meant more to me than you’ll ever know. Loving you has taught me what real love looks like choosing each other even when things get tough. I miss you so much, Shoniii baby, from the smallest things like your smile and your voice to the way you make everything feel safe and calm. You are my peace, my safe place, and the person I run to when the world feels heavy. As we step into this new year together, I want you to know that my love for you is constant, honest, and unconditional. I promise to keep choosing you, to keep loving you, and to stand by you through every challenge and every beautiful moment that comes our way. My heart is yours, today, tomorrow, and always. I love you endlessly, I miss you deeply, and I’m so grateful that I get to start this new year with you 🤍❤️✨
